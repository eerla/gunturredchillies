const blogs=[{title:"How to store dry red chillies for longer shelf life?",description:"Red chillies are essential in Indian cuisine, providing color, flavor, and taste; however, improper storage can lead to spoilage. To extend the shelf life of dry red chillies, it’s crucial to store them in airtight containers in a cool, dark place and to use them within a year. Common causes of spoilage include dehydration, light, oxygen, and temperature fluctuations. Tips for repacking include using vacuum-sealed bags, drying them with a food dehydrator, or storing them in sterilized glass jars. Avoid plastic bags and ensure chillies are completely dry before storage to prevent oxidation. Regularly inspect stored chillies for damage and label containers with packing dates. By following these guidelines, you can effectively prolong the freshness of your dry red chillies, making them last longer for your culinary needs."},{title:"5 Tips for Drying Red Chillies at Home",description:"Drying chillies at home is easy with these 5 tips: air dry, use a dehydrator, sun dry, oven dry, and microwave dry. Each method ensures long-lasting flavor and quality."},{title:"Did you know this about red dry chillies?",description:"Here are five must-know facts about red dried chillies: <strong>1. **High in Vitamin C**:</strong> Red dried chillies are packed with Vitamin C, even more than citrus fruits like oranges. They help boost the immune system and promote healthy skin. <strong>2. **Capsaicin Power**:</strong> The heat of red chillies comes from a compound called capsaicin. This compound not only adds spice but also has anti-inflammatory and pain-relief properties, making it popular in creams for sore muscles.   <strong>3. **Natural Preservative**:</strong> Due to their antimicrobial properties, dried red chillies act as a natural preservative. They prevent bacterial growth in foods, which is why they’re commonly used in pickles and spice blends. <strong>4. **Different Varieties, Different Heat Levels**:</strong> Not all red chillies are equally hot. Varieties like the Teja S17 are much hotter than others like the Kashmiri chilli, which is milder and used more for color than heat. <strong>5. **Boosts Metabolism**:</strong> Capsaicin in red chillies is known to increase metabolic rate, which can aid in fat burning and weight loss. It’s why spicy food often leaves you sweating – your body is burning more energy!"}];function zforms_open_window(url,height,width){var leftPos=0;var topPos=0;if(screen){leftPos=(screen.width-width)/2;topPos=(screen.height-height)/2;window.open(url,null,'width='+width+',height='+height+',left='+leftPos+',top='+topPos+', toolbar=0, location=0, status=1, scrollbars=1, resizable=1')}}
