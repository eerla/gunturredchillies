To extend the shelf life of dry red chillies, it’s crucial to store them in airtight containers in a cool, dark place and to use them within a year. Common causes of spoilage include dehydration, light, oxygen, and temperature fluctuations. Tips for repacking include using vacuum-sealed bags, drying them with a food dehydrator, or storing them in sterilized glass jars. Avoid plastic bags and ensure chillies are completely dry before storage to prevent oxidation. Regularly inspect stored chillies for damage and label containers with packing dates. By following these guidelines, you can effectively prolong the freshness of your dry red chillies, making them last longer for your culinary needs."},{title:"5 Tips for Drying Red Chillies at Home",description:"Drying chillies at home is easy with these 5 tips: air dry, use a dehydrator, sun dry, oven dry, and microwave dry.
